# chaupar
Chaupar(Chaupar) is a board game very similar to Pachisi of the Cross and Circle family played in India. It is believed that both games were created around the 4th century. The board is made of wool or cloth. The dice can be six cowry shells, although others distinguish chaupur from pachisi by the use of 3 tetrahedral (four sided) dice. The pawns are made of wood. It is usually played on a table or the floor.
